#+title: [PROJECT_NAME] - Strategic Planning and Index
#+date: [DATE]

* Top-Level TODOs and Milestones
  High-level tracking of major project goals and deliverables.
  
** TODO [Milestone 0: Architectural Foundations]
   DEADLINE: <YYYY-MM-DD>
   CRITICAL: Complete before coding
   - [ ] Document data schema (entities, relationships, invariants)
   - [ ] Create ADRs for core decisions (database, auth, patterns)
   - [ ] Map critical workflows (user journeys, data flows)
   - [ ] Document integration points
   - [ ] Define MUST constraints in AGENTS.md
  
** TODO [Milestone 1: Project Setup]
   DEADLINE: <YYYY-MM-DD>
   - [ ] Initialize project structure
   - [ ] Set up development environment
   - [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - [ ] Validate foundations documentation complete

** TODO [Milestone 2: Core Features]
   DEADLINE: <YYYY-MM-DD>
   - [ ] Implement feature A
   - [ ] Implement feature B
   - [ ] Integration testing

** TODO [Milestone 3: Polish & Deploy]
   DEADLINE: <YYYY-MM-DD>
   - [ ] Performance optimization
   - [ ] Security audit
   - [ ] Production deployment

* LLM Usage Guidelines
  Best practices for working with AI coding agents on this project.
  
** When to Use AI Agents
   - Implementing well-defined features from TODO.org files
   - Writing boilerplate code following established patterns
   - Debugging issues with clear reproduction steps
   - Updating documentation alongside code changes

** When NOT to Use AI Agents
   - Making architectural decisions (requires human judgment)
   - Handling security-critical code (requires expert review)
   - Refactoring large sections without clear plan
   - Making breaking changes without discussion

** AI Agent Workflow
   1. Agent reads AGENTS.md for instructions
   2. Agent checks module README.md and TODO.org
   3. Agent implements following existing patterns
   4. Agent updates documentation in same commit
   5. Agent updates TODO.org status
   6. Human reviews and approves changes

* Testing Strategy
  
** Unit Tests
   - Framework: [e.g., Jest, pytest, etc.]
   - Location: [e.g., src/**/__tests__/]
   - Coverage goal: [e.g., 80% for critical paths]
   - Run: [command to run unit tests]

** Integration Tests
   - Framework: [e.g., Cypress, Playwright, etc.]
   - Location: [e.g., tests/integration/]
   - Coverage goal: [e.g., all critical user flows]
   - Run: [command to run integration tests]

** End-to-End Tests
   - Framework: [e.g., Selenium, Puppeteer, etc.]
   - Location: [e.g., tests/e2e/]
   - Coverage goal: [e.g., smoke tests for production]
   - Run: [command to run e2e tests]
